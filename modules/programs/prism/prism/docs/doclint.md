# Doc-lint convention

<!-- doclint-ignore: mountTypeAllowlist, bind_source_outside_allowlist:<path>, agent_status.work_dir -->
<!-- doclint-ignore: CgroupBudget -->
<!-- doclint-ignore: refs/stash, AllPackages.nix, allPackages.nix -->
<!-- doclint-ignore: AGENTS.md -->
<!--
  Every token in the doclint-ignore lists above is intentionally
  unresolvable and appears in this doc as a historical example of the
  class of drift the lint catches:

  - `mountTypeAllowlist`, `bind_source_outside_allowlist:<path>`, and
    `agent_status.work_dir` are three of the nine stale identifiers
    caught across the three review cycles of PR #2333. They are cited
    verbatim in the "Why this lint exists" section as concrete drift
    examples, so they MUST remain unresolvable — rewriting them to real
    identifiers would strip the section's point.
  - `CgroupBudget` is referenced as the annotation example in the
    "Annotation — opting out of a specific finding" section; it is a
    hypothetical field in the podman-proxy field-admission walkthrough.
  - `refs/stash`, `AllPackages.nix`, `allPackages.nix` are the same
    counter-example set carried over from the AGENTS.md doclint-ignore
    block, mentioned here as canonical worked examples of when to reach
    for the annotation.
  - `AGENTS.md` is a cross-boundary reference to the repo-root file. In
    a full checkout the basename resolves; in the nix sandbox where
    only the prism subtree is copied in, it does not exist. Same
    situation as the equivalent annotation in podman-proxy.md.

This document specifies the doc-lint that verifies backticked identifier-shaped
tokens in prism's markdown docs resolve against the current source tree.

The lint is implemented in
[`internal/doclint`](../internal/doclint/) and enforced by
`TestDocsResolve` under `go test ./...` — it therefore inherits the existing
pr-gate enforcement (both the `go-tests` CI job and the homeless-shelter
`nix-build-prism-checked` job run it) via issue #2334.

## Why this lint exists

Backticked identifiers in markdown drift from the source they reference as
the code evolves — functions get renamed, fields get added/removed, files
get split. PR #2333 (the podman-proxy train's closer) went through three
review cycles of `review-code` and `review-context` catching stale
identifiers by hand. Examples: `bind_source_outside_allowlist:<path>`
where the source emits `host_bind:<path>`, `mountTypeAllowlist` where the
source has an inline `switch`, `agent_status.work_dir` where the column
is `instance_id`, and six others. Each cycle's fixup commit closed one
batch and missed another 1–3 of the same class, which the next cycle
then caught.

That pattern — cycle-by-cycle catching identifier drift — is a defining
signature of "needs a structural fix, not more review." Review cycles cost
~10 minutes × 5 agents each. A `grep` catches these in seconds and can
run on every prism-touching PR. Issue #2334 tracks the fix. This document
is its operational spec.

## What the lint checks

For each markdown file in scope (see [Scope](#scope) below), the lint:

1. Extracts every backticked span outside fenced code blocks.
2. Strips trailing punctuation and skips tokens that are placeholders
   (`<sessionName>`), URLs, CLI flags, quoted content, assignments, and so on
   — see `internal/doclint/classify.go` for the full skip matrix.
3. Classifies each surviving token into one of the identifier classes below.
4. Attempts to resolve the token against an index of the prism source tree.
5. Reports every unresolved token with the file, line, offending token, and
   the resolution rule that was attempted.

### Token classes and resolution rules

| Class | Example | Resolution rule |
|---|---|---|
| `file_path` | `` `internal/podmanproxy/policy.go` `` | `os.Stat` against `<prismRoot>/<path>` and `<repoRoot>/<path>`. |
| `file_with_member` | `` `policy.go::checkHostConfig` `` | The file must exist (bare basename resolves against the walked file index. A full relative path resolves via `os.Stat`), and the member must appear as an identifier in some indexed source file. |
| `bare_filename` | `` `proxy_test.go` `` | The basename must exist somewhere under the walked source tree. |
| `dotted` | `` `Config.MaxMemoryBytes` `` or `` `agent_status.instance_id` `` | Every segment must appear as an identifier in some indexed source file. SQL `table.column` references resolve because CREATE TABLE / SELECT strings contain the column and table names as word tokens. |
| `go_ident` | `` `checkHostConfig`, `NewIsolated` `` | Must appear as an identifier in some indexed source file. Requires mixed case (both upper- and lower-case letters) — pure lowercase words are treated as English prose and skipped. |
| `snake_case` | `` `agent_max_open_files_soft` `` | Must appear as an identifier in some indexed source file. |
| `env_var` | `` `CONTAINER_HOST` `` | Must appear as an identifier in some indexed source file. All-caps with underscores and length ≥ 3. |
| `colon_token` | `` `host_bind:<path>`, `cap_add:SYS_ADMIN` `` | The prefix (before `:`) must appear as an identifier OR as a substring of some Go string literal. When the suffix is not a placeholder or plain value, it is recursively resolved against the same rule set. |

The rules are deliberately conservative. When a token is ambiguous — for
example, a lowercase word that reads as either Go prose or a Go identifier
— the lint skips it. High precision beats high recall: a lint that
false-positives on unrelated PRs gets deleted.

### Scope

- `modules/programs/prism/prism/docs/*.md` — always scanned. These live
  inside the prism subtree that the nix sandbox build copies in.
- The repo-root `AGENTS.md` — scanned when it is present. Inside the nix
  sandbox (`runChecks = true`, only the prism subtree is copied in),
  it is absent and the lint skips it gracefully.

The source index that resolution runs against covers:

- Go source under `modules/programs/prism/prism/` (always).
- Nix source anywhere under the repo (walked recursively, when the repo
  root is available).
- TypeScript / JavaScript source under `modules/programs/prism/pi/` (when
  the repo root is available).

## Annotation — opting out of a specific finding

Some backticked identifiers are intentionally unresolvable. Examples
include a hypothetical field used in a walkthrough (`CgroupBudget` in
the podman proxy field-admission walkthrough), a name that describes an
external system (git internals like `refs/stash`), and a deliberate
counter-example (`AllPackages.nix` used in the file-naming rule).

Two annotation directives are recognised, both as HTML comments so they
do not render in the visible doc:

### Per-token: `<!-- doclint-ignore: token1, token2 -->`

```markdown
<!-- doclint-ignore: CgroupBudget, mountTypeAllowlist -->
```

Lists tokens to exempt from the lint for this file. Whitespace inside the
list is ignored. Multiple directives per file are allowed and their lists
union together.

Best practice: add a follow-up HTML comment that explains WHY the token
is intentionally unresolvable. That comment stops future readers from
silently promoting the annotation from "hypothetical" to "vanished from
source":

```markdown
<!-- doclint-ignore: CgroupBudget -->
<!-- `CgroupBudget` is a hypothetical field used in the field-admission
     walkthrough in §4. It does not exist and is not expected to. -->
```

### Per-file: `<!-- doclint-skip-file: [classes | ] reason -->`

```markdown
<!-- doclint-skip-file: this doc describes the external pi coding-agent RPC interface, not the prism Go source. -->
```

Opts the entire doc out of the lint. Use only for docs whose identifiers
live in a codebase outside this repository (for example, the wire-protocol
and RPC specs for the external pi coding-agent). The reason text after the
colon is required so the exemption is self-documenting. Its content is not
otherwise inspected.

**Per-class scoping (issue #2497).** The directive body may name one or
more lint classes before a `|` separator to opt out of only those
classes. Recognised class names: `identifiers`, `ste`.

```markdown
<!-- doclint-skip-file: identifiers | external TypeScript identifiers -->
<!-- doclint-skip-file: ste | machine-generated changelog, prose is templated -->
<!-- doclint-skip-file: identifiers, ste | equivalent to the unparameterised global form -->
```

An unparameterised directive (no `|` in the body) keeps its historical
global meaning: both classes are suppressed. This preserves the
pre-scoping behaviour for any doc that has not been migrated.
Unknown class names inside the list are silently dropped so a typo
does not accidentally widen the skip — an all-unknown list therefore
suppresses nothing.

Prefer per-token `doclint-ignore` over the whole-file skip. A file that
mixes in-tree and out-of-tree references must annotate the out-of-tree
tokens individually so drift on the in-tree ones still gets caught. A
doc that already carries an unparameterised skip should migrate to
`identifiers` (or the appropriate class list) so the other checks still
apply to its prose.

## Out-of-subtree path references

The scan reads backticked spans only (see [What the lint
checks](#what-the-lint-checks)). A bare, unbackticked path is prose to the
lint. The lint never scans it. A backticked path is a `file_path` token. It
must resolve under the prism source root, or under the repo root when the
repo root is present.

The nix sandbox build copies the prism subtree only, so the repo root is
absent there. A backticked path outside the prism subtree resolves on a
developer worktree. It does not resolve in the nix build. It then fails the
`nix-build-prism-checked` CI job with no local signal.

`TestDocsResolve_NixSandboxConfiguration` closes that gap. It copies the
prism subtree to a location with no repo root, then runs the scan. An
out-of-subtree backticked path fails `go test` locally, the same way the
nix build fails.

Two routes let a doc reference an out-of-subtree file:

- Do not backtick the path. A bare path is not a token, so it never
  produces a finding.
- Backtick the path and add a `doclint-ignore` annotation for it. Add a
  follow-up comment that states why the path sits outside the prism
  subtree.

This class of failure cost PR #2676 two CI round trips. A doc referenced an
out-of-subtree path. The follow-up fix added a `doclint-ignore`, and its
explanatory comment backticked a second out-of-subtree path three lines
above. The scan reads inside HTML comments, so that comment became a new
finding. When a comment must name an out-of-subtree path, leave it
unbackticked.

## ASD-STE100 prose checks (issues #2490, #2496)

<!-- doclint-ignore: should, would, may, might, could, has, have, had, been, e, i, etc, leverage, seamlessly, robust, comprehensive, plethora, myriad -->
<!--
  These are English words the STE section names by rule. They are
  backticked in the prose below (which strips them from STE scanning),
  but they can appear in nested doclint contexts. The ignore list is
  defence in depth.
-->

Alongside the identifier-resolution scan above, the same package runs
mechanical ASD-STE100 (Simplified Technical English) checks on a
narrow set of docs. The rule of the STE lint matches the rule of the
identifier lint: high precision beats high recall.

### The eight checks

| Rule tag                  | STE section | Detects |
|---------------------------|-------------|---------|
| `ste-8.1-semicolon`       | 8.1         | Literal `;` outside code. Rule 8.1 requires two sentences instead. |
| `ste-4.2-contraction`     | 4.2         | `` `'ll` ``, `` `'re` ``, `` `'ve` ``, `` `'d` ``, `` `n't` ``. Possessive `` `'s` `` is NOT a contraction and never fires. |
| `ste-gr6-latin`           | GR-6        | `` `e.g.` ``, `` `i.e.` ``, `` `etc.` ``. Use "for example", "that is", "and more". |
| `ste-3.2-modal`           | 3.2         | `` `should` ``, `` `would` ``, `` `may` ``, `` `might` ``, `` `could` ``. Apply the modal ladder: `` `must` `` for a requirement, `` `can` `` for capability, delete or restate a recommendation, `` `If X, then Y` `` for a hypothetical. |
| `ste-3.4-perfect`         | 3.4         | `` `has been` ``, `` `have been` ``, `` `had been` ``. Use the simple past or present. |
| `ste-slop`                | (skill)     | A word or phrase from the substitution table in the `simple-english` skill: `` `leverage` ``, `` `utilize` ``, `` `seamlessly` ``, `` `effortlessly` ``, `` `robust` ``, `` `comprehensive` ``, `` `performant` ``, `` `functionality` ``, `` `facilitate` ``, `` `streamline` ``, `` `plethora` ``, `` `myriad` ``, `` `blazingly` ``. Phrases: `` `in order to` ``, `` `prior to` ``, `` `it is worth noting` ``, `` `due to the fact that` ``, `` `in the event that` ``, `` `when it comes to` ``, `` `out of the box` ``, `` `under the hood` ``, `` `state-of-the-art` ``, `` `dive into` ``, `` `delve into` ``, `` `enables you to` ``, `` `allows you to` ``. Delete the word or write the plain replacement. |
| `ste-3.5-ing-after-comma` | 3.5         | An `-ing` verb clause after a comma (trailing participle). Restructure into two sentences or use the simple present. The check runs only on prose paragraphs — tables, headings, and list items are skipped because `-ing` words there are almost always adjectives or gerund nouns. |
| `ste-6.3-sentence-length` | 6.3 / 5.1   | A sentence over 25 words. Rule 5.1 sets a stricter 20-word limit for procedural text and Rule 6.3 sets 25 for descriptive text. The lint cannot classify a passage as procedural or descriptive, so the more permissive descriptive 25-word limit applies uniformly. |

Fenced code blocks and inline backticked spans are stripped before the
first seven checks run. A doc that documents these rules by name can
therefore backtick the banned tokens without tripping its own checks.
That is why the table above backticks every offending example.

### `ste-3.5-ing-after-comma` false positives in inline prose

The table / heading / list-item skip already documented above covers
the common false-positive surface. An `-ing` word after a comma in a
table cell, a heading, or a list item is almost always an adjective or a
gerund noun. It is almost never a trailing participle clause. The same false positive
also occurs in ordinary prose paragraphs, where the check still runs.

Worked example, hit twice across the Phase 1 and Phase 2 remediations of
issue #2497: `..., thinking blocks, ...` in a prose enumeration in
`docs/pi-rpc-interface.md`, and `... specifies the transport layer (§2),
framing rules (§3), ...` in `docs/pi-wire-protocol.md`. In both cases the
`-ing` word (`thinking`, `framing`) modifies the following noun
("thinking blocks", "framing rules") rather than opening a trailing
participle clause. The check has no way to distinguish that case from a
genuine Rule 3.5 violation. It matches on the comma-then-`-ing` shape
alone.

Two resolutions are both acceptable:

- **Reorder** the sentence so the `-ing` word no longer immediately
  follows a comma. This is what both worked examples above did — for
  instance, `pi-wire-protocol.md` moved the `framing rules (§3)` item to
  the front of the list, ahead of any comma.
- **Per-token `doclint-ignore`** with an explanatory comment, when a
  reorder would read worse than the original or would obscure the point
  being made.

Expect roughly one of these per document scanned. The pattern recurs
whenever a doc enumerates several noun phrases and one of them happens
to begin with a gerund.

### Sentence-length tokenisation

The sentence-length check consumes the raw content, not the
stripped-code view. Rule 8.6 needs backticks visible so that each
backticked span counts as ONE word, not as its internal letter count.
The tokeniser applies these STE rules from Section 8:

- **Rule 8.5.** Text inside parentheses counts as ONE word.
- **Rule 8.6.** A backticked span, a number with a unit (`5 s`, `10ms`,
  `100%`), quoted text, and an alphanumeric identifier each count as
  ONE word.
- **Rule 8.7.** A hyphenated word counts as ONE word.
- **Rule 8.4.** A vertical-list lead-in colon ends a sentence for
  word-count purposes. In markdown, a paragraph that ends with `:`
  before a list block satisfies this naturally.

Sentence boundaries: a `.`, `!`, or `?` followed by whitespace and a
capital letter, an emphasis marker (`*`, `_`), an open bracket, or a
backtick. The heuristic under-detects rather than over-detects. A bare
`.` mid-sentence, `1.5`, `.md`, and abbreviations like `U.S.` do not
split, which biases the check toward precision.

List items, table cells, headings, block quotes, HTML block markup,
and indented code blocks are excluded from sentence-length scanning.

### Deliberate omissions

The STE lint deliberately does NOT check any of the following:

- **Passive voice, part-of-speech rulings, synonym rotation.** Permanently
  out of scope. These need a grammar parser and belong to the
  `simple-english` skill and to human review.

### Scope: only these docs

The STE checks run only against these files, matched by basename under
`<prismRoot>/docs/` (nested subdirectories like `docs/invariants/` or
`docs/diagnoses/` do NOT participate):

- `docs/doclint.md`
- `docs/podman-proxy.md`
- `docs/sandbox-exec-testing.md`
- `docs/stdout-capture-testing.md`
- `docs/pi-rpc-interface.md` (added in Phase 1 of issue #2497, alongside
  the scoping of its `doclint-skip-file` directive to identifiers only)
- `docs/pi-wire-protocol.md` (added in Phase 2 of issue #2497, alongside
  the same identifiers-only scoping of its `doclint-skip-file` directive)

The in-scope set is the constant `steInScopeBasenames` in
`internal/doclint/ste.go`. Extending it further is a deliberate scope
decision, not a routine change. `agents/*.md` and `skills/*/SKILL.md`
carry 73 banned modals tracked by #2493, and a lint covering them
cannot land green today.

### Skip-file scoping (issue #2497)

The `<!-- doclint-skip-file: reason -->` directive accepts an optional
class list before a `|` separator. A doc can then opt out of one lint
category while remaining subject to the other. See the [Per-file](#per-file----doclint-skip-file-classes--reason---)
section above for the syntax.

An unparameterised directive is treated as `identifiers, ste` — the
pre-scoping global behaviour. This is the invariant that let
`docs/pi-wire-protocol.md` keep its global skip through Phase 1 of
the #2497 migration without a silent change. Phase 2 then migrated it
to the `identifiers`-only scope described below.

Phase 1 moved `docs/pi-rpc-interface.md` to the `identifiers`-only scope
and cleared the resulting STE findings. Its skip reason cites external
TypeScript identifier resolution, which has nothing to do with prose
quality. The doc is a human-readable interface spec and its prose is now
scanned.

Phase 2 did the same for `docs/pi-wire-protocol.md`. It is the larger
of the two pi docs. It was also the single largest source of STE
findings measured against the eight checks: 107 findings across seven
of the eight rule tags. All 107 were remediated. See the Phase 2 PR
description for the full per-rule breakdown.

The per-token `<!-- doclint-ignore: <token1>, <token2> -->` directive
suppresses matching STE findings the same way it suppresses identifier
findings. The offending text is looked up in the union of all
doclint-ignore lists in the file, and a match skips the finding.

## Enumeration rules — the podman-proxy channel set (issue #2974)

A third rule family runs beside the identifier scan and the STE checks.
It holds every prose enumeration of the podman-proxy channel set to the
Go declaration the policy code reads.

### Why this family exists

A container-create body reaches a named volume through several
channels, and `internal/podmanproxy/policy.go` polices each one. Prose
across the repo enumerates the same set. It also enumerates which of
the checks are gated on `Config.VolumeNamePrefix`. Nothing linked the
prose to the code before this family, so both enumerations drifted.

PR #2961 added a channel and left stale prose behind it. Review round 3
found one stale site. The author then swept for that class by hand, and
round 4 found another site. A careful human sweep missed one, which is
the signal that the check must be mechanical.

### The declaration is the source of truth

Two declarations in `internal/podmanproxy/policy.go` carry the sets:

- `namePolicyChannels` — one row per name-policy channel. Each row
  names the config field, the policy function, the audit reason, and
  whether an absent name gets an injected one.
- `createVolumeChecks` — one row per check the named-volume policy
  applies, and which side of the prefix gate the check sits on.

The policy functions take their audit reasons from those rows.
`volumeNamePrefixFor` is the only reader of `Config.VolumeNamePrefix`
in the package, so a change of gate passes through the declaration.

### The four rules

| Rule tag | Detects |
|---|---|
| `podman-channel-decl` | A row with an empty field. A `checkFunc` that `policy.go` does not declare. A row that no function reads, or that the wrong function reads. A `prefix_mismatch` audit reason that no row declares. A `create_volumes` audit reason that no check claims. A direct read of `Config.VolumeNamePrefix` outside `volumeNamePrefixFor`. |
| `podman-channel-table` | The canonical table in `docs/podman-proxy.md` and the declaration disagree. A declared channel with no row, a row with no declared channel, or a wrong "Absent name" cell. |
| `podman-gate-section` | The canonical gated section above `checkCreateVolumeNames` names a check on the wrong side of the gate, or the section anchor is gone. |
| `podman-channel-count` | A prose count phrase states a number that the declaration contradicts. |

### The canonical prose sites

The channel table sits between two markers in `docs/podman-proxy.md`:

```markdown
<!-- doclint-enumeration: name-policy-channels -->
| Channel | Config field | Policy function | Deny reason | Absent name |
...
<!-- doclint-enumeration-end -->
```

The row match is line-oriented, not cell-oriented. A row matches a
channel when the line carries the config field, the policy function,
and the deny reasons of that channel. Column order, column width, and
the prose of the Channel column are all free to change.

The gated enumeration is the section headed `# What is gated on the
prefix, and what is not` in the doc comment above
`checkCreateVolumeNames`. The rule splits that section at the sentence
that carries `NOT gated`, then requires each declared check to appear
on its own side by `proseName`.

### Count phrases

These phrases carry a number that the declaration also states. `N`
stands for a count word (`one` to `twelve`) or a decimal number:

```text
N named-volume channels        -> the named-volume channel count
N container-create channels    -> the named-volume channel count
N name-policy channels         -> every declared channel
N mount-channel reasons        -> distinct named-volume deny reasons
VolumeNamePrefix covers N surfaces -> channels the volume prefix covers
N check(s) of the N is gated   -> gated checks, and every check
The other N are NOT gated      -> un-gated checks
```

The last two run against the canonical gated section alone. A capture
that is not a number is not a count phrase, and produces no finding.

A prose site that wants this enforcement writes one of these phrases.
Any other phrasing is unenforced prose.

### A deliberate subset is not a finding

The patterns name the whole set. A doc comment that describes only the
channels one function handles — "Two channels, two consequences" above
`checkMountedVolumeNames` — matches no pattern, so it produces no
finding. This is the same precision rule the rest of the lint follows.

### Scope

The count patterns run against the prism docs and the comments of every
file in `internal/podmanproxy/`, test files included. They also run
against the markdown under modules/programs/prism/agents/ and
modules/programs/prism/skills/, when the repo root is available. The
declaration rules read `internal/podmanproxy/policy.go` alone.

The whole family is silent when `docs/podman-proxy.md` is absent, which
is the shape of the synthetic scan roots in this package's tests. When
that doc IS present, an absent or unparseable `policy.go` is itself a
finding.

## Failure output

When the lint fails, `TestDocsResolve` prints one line per finding in
this shape:

```
/abs/path/to/AGENTS.md:60: unresolved `darwinConfigurations` (rule=go_ident): identifier not found anywhere in prism .go source
```

The `rule=` tag names which resolution path was tried. Use it to debug
false positives (usually the token classifies into an unexpected class)
and false negatives (usually a case-sensitivity or word-boundary issue in
the source index).

## Dual-context: full checkout vs nix sandbox

The test runs in two environments and must pass in both:

1. **Full repo checkout** — the `go-tests` CI job and local `go test ./...`.
   Both `modules/programs/prism/prism/docs/*.md` and the repo-root
   `AGENTS.md` are scanned. The index covers Go, Nix, and pi-TS source.
2. **Nix sandbox** — the `nix-build-prism-checked` CI job with
   `runChecks = true`. Only the prism subtree is copied into the build,
   and `$HOME=/homeless-shelter` is unwritable. The repo-root `AGENTS.md`
   does not exist and the lint skips it gracefully. The index covers
   Go source only.

`TestDocsResolve` runs in whichever environment invokes it, so it only
reaches the nix-sandbox configuration under the checked nix build.
`TestDocsResolve_NixSandboxConfiguration` reaches that configuration under a
plain `go test` as well. It copies the prism subtree to a location with no
repo-root `AGENTS.md`. The per-doc repo-root lookup then returns the empty
string for real. See [Out-of-subtree path
references](#out-of-subtree-path-references).

The lint locates its scan roots via `runtime.Caller`, never via `$HOME`
or `os.Getwd()`, so nothing about the environment matters other than
"can I read the source files that were copied in".

## Adding a new token class

If a new identifier shape recurs in prose and the current classifier
skips it, extend `internal/doclint/classify.go` with a new
`tokenClass`. Then add the resolver in `internal/doclint/resolve.go`
and a unit test in `classify_test.go` / `scan_test.go`. Keep the rule
conservative — err on the side of skipping ambiguous tokens.

## Out of scope

- Semantic drift ("this function does X" when it now does Y) — needs
  human review, not a grep.
- Stale identifiers in Go comments — start with markdown docs. Expand
  to comments only if signal justifies it.
- External references (URLs, third-party docs, stdlib package paths).
- Cross-repo identifier resolution (for example, into the pi coding-agent
  package). Docs that describe such interfaces use
  `<!-- doclint-skip-file -->`.
