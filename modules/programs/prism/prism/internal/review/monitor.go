// monitor.go — group-completion monitor for async review.
//
// After `prism review` spawns the 5 review-agent sessions and registers a
// group, it starts a detached monitor subprocess (via cmd/monitor_review.go
// using `prism monitor-review`). The monitor polls db.GroupCompleted every 5 s;
// when the group is complete it aggregates results via db.GroupResults,
// formats them with FormatResults, and delivers to the worker via
// `prism prompt`. On delivery failure, it retries with bounded backoff then
// writes the fallback file.
//
// MonitorOpts is passed from the cmd layer; MonitorFunc is the entry-point
// called by the monitor-review subcommand.

		// without a parseable verdict — empty LastMessage, startup_error, or
		// mid-analysis truncation — is NOT counted: the worker is expected to
		// re-run.
		//
		// The read is GroupResultsAll, not GroupResults.
		// The `ended_at IS NULL` filter on GroupResults is correct on the live
		// aggregation path — it is what makes the cleanup escape hatch
		// work — and wrong here. Review agents are released automatically
		// 15 minutes after their round is delivered, so by the time a later
		// round asks "how many cycles came before me", every earlier round's
		// rows are closed. Through the narrow read this loop would count zero
		// every time, and the LOOP-LIMIT footer — the thing that tells a worker
		// to stop and escalate at three cycles — would never fire. The release
		// deletes no row and no event, so the wider read still sees the full
		// history.
		//
		// Widening the read does not loosen the predicate. A row closed while
		// still non-terminal, or closed before it emitted a verdict, is
		// visible with its real state and its empty LastMessage, and
		// ClassifyRound rejects it for that reason instead of for its absence.
		// The abandoned-agent row reads as state "interrupted", which is
		// not verdict-producing, so that round still does not count.
		//
		// The expected member list comes from gMembers (agent_status rows,
		// including closed ones), NOT from the groupData keys: counting the
		// keys that came back cannot detect a member that never came back.
		//
		// Rationale: a lenient predicate ("at least one finished member
		// with non-empty LastMessage") would trip the LOOP-LIMIT at cycle 3
		// even when only 3 of 5 agents emitted verdicts and the other two
		// finished with no parseable `<verdict>` tag. See
