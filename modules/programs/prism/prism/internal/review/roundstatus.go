// roundstatus.go — the single classifier for "did every agent in this review
// round produce a verdict, and if not, why?"
//
// ClassifyRound is the single source of truth for this question. Three call
// sites depend on the answer:
//
//   - buildMonitorResults      → per-agent AgentResult.Output strings
//   - buildDeliveryMessage     → the header branch (no-start / stall / …)
//   - currentCycleProducedVerdicts + CompletedReviewCyclesForParent
//     → whether the round counts against the 3-cycle LOOP-LIMIT
//
// The classifier walks the EXPECTED agent list, not the db.GroupResults map
// that happened to come back. db.GroupResults drops any agent_status row whose
// ended_at is set (the cleanup escape hatch), so a review agent whose session
// was closed mid-round is absent from the map. A classifier that read the map
// alone would report "4 verdicts", count the round as a full cycle, and read
// the lost dimension as a pass — a silent failure. Walking the expected list
// makes an absent member a first-class outcome with a class and a reason,
// exactly like a no-start or a mid-run stall.
//
// Cycle-counting contract. A round counts against the 3-cycle limit only when
// every expected agent produced a parseable verdict — RoundStatus.CountsAsCycle
// is Complete(). This extends the existing "rounds that do not count"
// machinery rather than adding a parallel mechanism. The same predicate backs
// both the in-flight monitor gate and the historical count in
// CompletedReviewCyclesForParent.
