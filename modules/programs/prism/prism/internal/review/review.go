// Package review implements the prism review execution engine.
//
// prism review <pr-number> spawns N review agent sessions as independent
// top-level tmux sessions named <parent>~review-<N>-<agent-name> (where N is
// the 1-indexed round number), polls the prism DB until all agents reach the
// "finished" state, reads their last msg_assistant event, and returns
// aggregated findings to stdout.
//
// Session architecture:
//   - Five independent top-level tmux sessions per review round:
//     <parent>~review-<N>-review-goal
//     <parent>~review-<N>-review-code
//     <parent>~review-<N>-review-security
//     <parent>~review-<N>-review-qa
//     <parent>~review-<N>-review-context
//   - Each session has its own port allocation, sidecar, and container.
//   - A round's sessions are released automatically 15 minutes after its
//     review-complete prompt is delivered (reap.go): the tmux session and
//     the harness port go back, and every DB row survives. A round is NOT
//     held until prism cleanup of the parent.
//   - No round-level multi-window session is created.
//
// The ~ separator in the session name is used by the dashboard for depth-2
// child detection (review sessions appear indented under their parent branch).
//
// Readiness gate:
//
// Each per-agent session.SpawnSession call only returns "the tmux session was
// created and the sidecar process was kicked off" — the agent itself runs
// inside the sandbox or host process the tmux pane launches, several steps
// further along, and may take seconds to bind its TCP port (≈8.5s observed
// in the worst healthy case) or never bind at all if
// startup fails silently. The spawn loop therefore runs a per-agent
// readiness gate via gateReviewAgents (see readiness.go) after spawning, in
// parallel goroutines so one slow agent does not delay the others.
//
// Each gate calls session.WaitForReady, which polls the DB for either:
//   - any state_change event (the sidecar wrote one when the first SSE event
//     arrived from the agent, which can only happen after the agent bound its
//     port), or
//   - agent_status.harness_session_id becoming non-NULL (the sidecar saw
//     the agent's session.created event).
//
// The default per-agent readiness window is 30s
// (DefaultReviewReadinessTimeout). On timeout, the gate emits
// "<role> failed to start: not ready within 30s" via OnProgress, populates
// the spawn-failure slot for that agent, and runs the standard cleanup
// (KillSidecar + cleanupAgentSession + tmux.KillSession). The other agents
// are unaffected; the review proceeds with the survivors.
//
// Per-agent startup log:
//
// Each spawned session has an agent-startup.log file in its run directory:
//
//	$XDG_STATE_HOME/prism/run/<12-hex-of-sha256(session)>/agent-startup.log
//
// SpawnSession writes timestamped breadcrumbs to this file describing the
// spawn-time sequence (DB seed, port allocation, tmux session creation,
// sidecar startup, readiness gate outcome). It is the forensic trail
// covering the gap between "session created in DB" and "first SSE event
// arrives at the sidecar" — exactly the window in which the silent failure
// occurs. The bwrap-side stderr lands in agent-run.log in
// the same directory; together they cover the full pre-agent startup
// timeline.
//
// Async Ack contract:
//
// RunAsync's AsyncResult.Ack distinguishes successfully-ready agents from
// failed-to-spawn / failed-to-ready agents:
//
//	Spawned: 3, Failed: 2 (review-goal: not ready within 30s, review-qa: not ready within 30s)
//
// so the worker session reading the Ack sees a partial-success outcome
// immediately instead of discovering it 20 minutes later when the monitor
// timeout fires.
