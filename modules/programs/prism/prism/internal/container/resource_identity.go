// Resource identity for the containers and volumes an agent creates
// through the podman proxy.
//
// # Why a name prefix is not an identity
//
// Before this file existed, a session claimed a container or a volume by
// name-prefix equality: the proxy admitted a name that started with
// `prism-<sanitised-session>-`, and `prism cleanup` swept every name
// that started with the same string. Prefix equality is a HEURISTIC for
// identity, and two distinct live sessions collide under it in two
// independent ways (issue #2951):
//
//  1. FOLDING. sanitiseSessionName folds `@`, `/`, `.`, and `~` all to
//     `-`, so `repo@feat/x` and `repo@feat-x` produce the same prefix.
//  2. NESTING. One session name can be a strict prefix of another.
//     Session `foo` gets `prism-foo-`; live session `foo-bar` gets
//     `prism-foo-bar-`. The volume `prism-foo-bar-data` belongs to
//     `foo-bar` and also starts with `prism-foo-`.
//
// Both let one session claim another LIVE session's resources, in both
// directions: a sweep reaches a colliding sibling's volume, which holds
// data, and the guard that suppresses that sweep leaks the resources it
// spares.
//
// No separator rule closes either one. `isAllowedBindSource` closes the
// substring trap for host PATHS by requiring an exact match or a match
// on the entry plus `/`, but that technique does not transfer here:
// `prism-foo-bar-data` already carries the separator after `prism-foo-`,
// and it is a legitimate name for session `foo-bar`. The ambiguity is in
// the name space itself.
//
// # The identity
//
// A session incarnation's instance ID is its identity. It is a UUID, it
// is unique across every session on the host, and no two incarnations
// share one. This file records that identity ON the resource, by
// encoding it in the name prefix at a FIXED, left-anchored position:
//
//	prism-<instance token>-<sanitised session name>-<free-form suffix>
//
// `ResourceOwnerToken` reads the owner back out with an exact segment
// parse — the text between `prism-` and the next `-` — and never with a
// prefix test. That is what makes ownership a decision about identity
// rather than about a shared string. Position matters: the token has to
// be left-anchored, because the text AFTER the sanitised session name is
// free-form (the volume policy admits any user-chosen suffix inside the
// prefix), so a token placed later in the name cannot be located without
// a prefix test, and a prefix test is the thing being replaced.
//
// # The containment invariant
//
// The proxy still admits a create request by testing the name against
// the session's prefix. That is SOUND, and it is deliberately not the
// same statement as "ownership is prefix equality":
//
//	admitted ⊆ owned
//
// A name that starts with `prism-<token>-<decor>-` necessarily has owner
// token `<token>`, because `<token>` is 32 hex characters and carries no
// `-` for the segment parse to stop at early. So every name the proxy
// admits is owned by the admitting session, while the sweep decides what
// it owns by the exact parse. The proxy therefore stays a stdlib-only
// package with one string comparison, and the identity decision lives in
// exactly one place. TestResourceIdentity_AdmittedNamesAreOwned pins the
// invariant.
//
// # Sessions with no usable identity
//
// `InstanceTokenForID` returns "" for anything that is not a canonical
// UUID. Production instance IDs always are (`uuid.New().String()`), so
// this covers out-of-tree callers, ad-hoc bring-up, and tests. Such a
// session falls back to `ResourceNamePrefixForSession`, keeps the
// pre-identity behaviour, and is swept by the legacy half of
// cmd/cleanup_sweep.go. Failing closed here — refusing to run the proxy
// — would be the wrong direction: the agent does not choose its own
// instance ID, so an unusable one is a prism configuration fault and not
// an attack.

// accepts the unhyphenated, URN, and brace-wrapped forms. Accepting
// those would make the ID → token map non-injective: two DIFFERENT
