// Package sidecar implements the core logic for the prism sidecar process.
//
// The sidecar subscribes to the agent runtime's event stream (via a
// harness.Harness adapter) and translates events into agent state transitions,
// DB writes, and dashboard sentinel touches — replicating the logic in
// pi/plugins/prism-hooks.ts.
//
// Host-API socket path budget. The Unix socket the sidecar binds for the
// host-API server (Config.HostAPISockPath) must fit the kernel's sun_path
// limit: 108 bytes on Linux, 104 bytes on Darwin. The sidecar treats 104 as
// the budget for both platforms so the same code path works everywhere. The
// path is constructed by session.SidecarHostAPIPath and uses a 12-hex-char
// SHA-256 prefix of the session name as the per-session directory. The
// regression tests in internal/session/sidecar_test.go
// (TestSidecarHostAPIPath_LengthInvariant_*) cover the path arithmetic.
// If a future change reverts that to a long-form session name, those tests
// will fail with a clear message before the bug ships.
//
// All runtime-specific logic (session creation, prompt delivery, SSE
// subscription, event type mapping, message extraction, container command,
// health check, config mount path) is delegated to the Harness interface.
// The concrete implementation used in production is internal/harness/pi.
// The Harness value is injected at construction time via Config.Harness.
//
// In container mode (Config.Container != nil — a legacy of the removed
// container isolation mode, which no current mode sets), the sidecar also
// manages the container lifecycle: create, health-check, stop, remove.
//
// All timer and clock operations go through an abstracted Clock interface so
// that tests can control time deterministically.

//
//   - {"type":"state_change","state":"<state>"} — records an agent state
//     transition; valid values mirror agent.AgentState ("active", "finished",
//     "error", …).
//   - {"type":"msg_assistant","text":"<text>"} — records an assistant message
//     fragment.

// the payload, allowing forward compatibility.

// SIGKILL to the child. The sidecar reads frames until EOF (process exited).
// If the process exits 0 and the last state written was "finished", the session
// is considered cleanly terminated and runStartupStdio returns nil. Any other

// frame was not state=finished) is treated as a startup error.

//
// # Reconnect loop
//
// The listener stays open across connection drops. On an unexpected disconnect
// (no preceding session_shutdown), the sidecar flushes the accumulator, logs
// the drop, and waits up to pipeDisconnectTimeout for a new connection. If a
// new connection arrives within the window, the handshake is replayed and the
// frame loop resumes. If no connection arrives before the timeout (or ctx is
// cancelled), the session transitions to error state and the function returns.

//   - unknown types → logged and written to agent_events for forward-compat
//
// # Error handling
//
//   - Protocol version mismatch: error frame sent to extension, session → error
//   - Unexpected disconnect: flush accumulator, wait for reconnect; error after timeout
