// lifecycle.go — the seven lifecycle and outcome counters.
//
// All seven are produced by ONE tailer (TailerLifecycleEvents), running over
// the same agent_events table as the events tailer but keeping its own
// cursor. Every counter comes from the tail cursor, never from an aggregate
// over a pruned table — see LifecycleEventsTailSQL in sql.go for the query
// and the prune-safety argument for its join.
//
// The dispatch below is closed-set by construction: (*lifecycleCounters).apply
// only ever calls Inc on one of the seven CounterVecs constructed in New, and
// every label value handed to Inc is either a value already sanctioned as a
// safe label (repo, agent_role, isolation_mode, end_state, profile) or a
// value drawn from a small closed set (verdict: three values at the round
// level, four at the per-agent level). prism_spawns_total
// DOES carry a profile label — see the comment on LifecycleEventsTailSQL in
// sql.go for the boundary-test narrowing that makes this safe.

// Metric names for the seven counters.
