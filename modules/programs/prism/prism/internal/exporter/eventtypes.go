// The closed label set behind prism_agent_events_total{type}.
//
// # Why an allowlist and not the raw column
//
// agent_events.type looks like a closed set and is not one. Three facts
// compose into an unbounded-cardinality hole:
//
//  1. internal/sidecar/sidecar.go persists an unrecognised wire frame
//     verbatim — its `default:` branch calls writeEvent(frame.Type, ...) for
//     any type it does not have a case for. That is deliberate
//     forward-compatibility, and it is correct for the database.
//  2. internal/db WriteEvent does not validate the value.
//  3. internal/container/bwrap.go bind-mounts the per-session socket
//     directory read-write into the sandbox and exports PRISM_HARNESS_PIPE,
//     so a worker agent can write frames of its own choosing.
//
// A prompt-injected agent could therefore mint an unbounded number of label
// values. Each becomes a permanent series in a FLEET-WIDE Prometheus, shipped
// there by Alloy's remote_write, and — because this exporter persists and
// reloads its counter values — one injection would survive every restart.
//
// So the exporter folds the column through the allowlist below and puts
// everything else in a single OtherEventType bucket. The series count of the
// metric is then bounded by construction at MaxAgentEventsSeries, whatever
// the database holds. The fold is applied by the CounterVec itself
// (metrics.WithLabelValueNormaliser), which covers the restore path as well
// as the tail path, so a state file cannot reintroduce a value either.
//
// # Adding a type
//
// Add the string below. TestKnownEventTypes_CoversEveryStaticallyWrittenType
// walks the prism source and fails when a writer emits a type that is not
// here. It covers three shapes:
//
//  1. a string literal at a writer site — writeEvent("x", ...) or
//     db.Event{Type: "x"};
//  2. an identifier at a writer site that resolves to a package-level string
//     constant, qualified (db.SessionReapEventType) or not;
//  3. any package-level string constant named by the event-type convention
//     (Event<X> or <X>EventType), wherever it is declared. This one matters
//     because a constant can reach db.Event.Type through a helper's
//     PARAMETER — session.EventSpawnIntent does exactly that, through
//     writeSpawnEvent — and no writer-site scan can follow that.
//
// What the scan cannot see, in full:
//
//   - a type computed at run time;
//   - a type arriving from the wire through the verbatim `default:` path;
//   - a literal RETURNED by a mapping function and forwarded to a writer
//     through a local, as internal/harness/pi NormaliseFrame does;
//   - a literal on a `case` label whose body writes frame.Type, as
//     internal/sidecar/sidecar.go does for tool_call, tool_result,
//     provider_error, and auto_retry_end.
//
// The last two are static but sit away from the writer site. Every value
// they produce today is already in the list below, so there is no gap now;
// they are named here so this comment does not claim more coverage than the
// scan delivers. OtherEventType is the backstop for all four, and a rising
// `type="other"` is the signal to come back here.

// OtherEventType is the bucket every value outside knownEventTypes folds
// into. It is deliberately a value that no real event type uses.
const OtherEventType = "other"

// knownEventTypes is the set of agent_events.type values exposed verbatim.
//
// Derived from the writers in the prism tree: the literal writeEvent calls in
// internal/sidecar, the db.Event composite literals in cmd/ and internal/,
// db.SessionReapEventType, and the wire frame types that
// internal/sidecar/sidecar.go persists from a named case rather than from its
// `default:` branch.
