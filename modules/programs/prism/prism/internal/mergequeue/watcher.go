// Package mergequeue implements the local serial merge queue for prism.
//
// The Watcher is a goroutine started by the coordinator's sidecar on init.
// It polls the head of the pending_merges queue for the sidecar's session_name
// and drives PRs through the merge lifecycle using the GitHub CLI:
//
//   - CLEAN    → gh pr merge --squash
//   - UNSTABLE → gh pr merge --squash, but only when every required check
//     reports SUCCESS; optional checks are ignored
//   - BEHIND   → gh pr update-branch
//   - BLOCKED  → terminate as failed when every required check has concluded
//     and at least one concluded in a failure state; keep watching
//     otherwise, because an outstanding approval or a still-running check can
//     resolve on its own
//   - Others   → keep watching (transient)
//
// On each terminal outcome (merged, failed, closed) a bus notification is
// delivered to the enqueuing coordinator session via the harness HTTP API.
// Every notification names the PR. The merge and close outcomes add the worker
// session's archive path and prompt git pull + prism cleanup. The
// required-check failure outcome deliberately omits the cleanup prompt,
// because the branch is still needed for the fix.
//
// Watcher lifetime equals coordinator session lifetime. On sidecar shutdown,
// all watching rows for this instance_id are transitioned to 'abandoned' by
// AbandonWatchingMerges, preventing a future sidecar from inheriting stale rows.
