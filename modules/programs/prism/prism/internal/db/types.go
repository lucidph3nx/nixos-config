// One definition, used by every renderer that reads a Status row, so those
// surfaces cannot drift into showing different things for the same row.
// There are three, and all three call this method:
//
//	cmd/list_sessions.go        prism sessions list
//	cmd/checkin_list.go         prism checkin (no argument)
//	internal/dashboard/sessions.go  the tmux dashboard
//
// ONE PATH IS DELIBERATELY NOT COVERED, and the exception is named here
// rather than left for a reader to discover. internal/dashboard's
// applyPushEvent patches an ALREADY-RENDERED row in memory from the
// sidecar's push event, which carries a bare title string and no Status and
// no reference. It is not a Status renderer, so it cannot call this method.
//
// The consequence is bounded and self-correcting: a push event only
// overwrites the cell when its title is non-empty, and the sidecar populates
// that field solely from a harness-reported (human) title. So the cell can
// briefly lose its reference prefix on a session that was renamed by hand
// AND already carries an issue_ref, until the next poll re-reads the row and
// restores it. Widening the dashboard socket's wire shape to carry the
// reference was judged a worse trade than this: it is a compatibility
// surface between a running sidecar and a running dashboard, and the defect
// it would fix is a transient cosmetic one.
