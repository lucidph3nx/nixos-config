// Orphan-resource sweep for sessions with containers_enabled=1.
//
// Two resource classes are swept, in this order:
//
//  1. Containers the session owns.
//  2. Volumes the session owns.
//
// Both are gated on the SAME agent_status.containers_enabled read, so a
// session that never enabled containers issues no podman command at
// all.
//
// # Ownership is identity, not a shared prefix
//
// A resource created through the proxy carries the owning incarnation's
// INSTANCE ID in its name, left-anchored:
// `prism-<instance token>-<sanitised session>-<suffix>`.
// `resourceOwner` decides what to remove by parsing that token back out
// and comparing it, and never by testing one name prefix against
// another. Prefix equality is a heuristic for identity and two distinct
// live sessions collide under it — by folding and by nesting — so it
// could destroy a live sibling's data volume. See
// internal/container/resource_identity.go and issue #2951.
//
// A session that restarts gets a NEW instance ID, so the owner carries
// the token of EVERY incarnation of the session name, read from the
// `sessions` table. Cleaning a session therefore reaches the volumes its
// earlier incarnations created, which a single-token sweep would leak.
//
// # The legacy half
//
// A resource created before the identity prefix landed carries no token.
// It is still swept, by the pre-identity rule it was created under: the
// strict `prism-<sanitised session>-<8 hex chars>` shape for a container,
// the plain `prism-<sanitised session>-` prefix for a volume, and the
// sibling guard over both. That rule is ambiguous — that is why it was
// replaced — so the guard errs toward leaving a resource in place. See
// `legacySiblingPrefixes`.
//
// Images the session pulled are NOT swept. See docs/podman-proxy.md
// section 8.3 for the two conditions that work needs first.
//
// The container sweep complements the per-mode container teardown that
// `removeContainerIfExists` already performs: that path removes the
// SESSION'S OWN bwrap/sandbox-exec container (the agent's runtime),
// while this path sweeps any DERIVATIVE containers the agent created
// via the proxy during the session.
//
// The sweep is best-effort: each resource class gets its own
// 30-second context (60 seconds worst case across both classes),
// and any failure (podman not on PATH, machine off, socket missing,
// rm returns non-zero) is logged at warning level and does NOT abort
// cleanup. The worktree and DB teardown ALWAYS run regardless of
// sweep outcome — the containers_swept count is just an
// observability field in the `--json` envelope.
//
// Test seam: the runner that shells out to `podman` is interface-
// dispatched via `podmanRunnerForTest`, set by tests through
// SetTestPodmanRunner. Production wires it to execPodmanRunner.
