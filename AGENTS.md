# Agents Project Guidance: nixos-config

This document provides guidance for AI agents on how to interact with this NixOS configuration repository.

## Project Overview

- **Primary Goal:** This repository manages the personal NixOS configurations for multiple machines, all intended for a single user ("lucidph3nx").
- **Design Philosophy:**
    - Configurations are managed with Nix Flakes.
    - Home Manager and NixOS options are often configured together within the same module for simplicity.
    - The system aims for impermanence, with state managed via `impermanence`.
    - Secrets are managed with `sops-nix` and an age key.
    - The `unstable` channel is preferred for packages. Overlays are used to pin packages to `stable` or other versions only when necessary.

## Common Commands

- **Building/Testing Changes:** To validate configuration changes without applying them, use the `nh` helper command. This is the preferred method for checking for errors.
    - `nh os build`
- **Linting/Formatting:** Code is formatted with `nixfmt`.
    - `nix fmt`
- **Flake Validation:** To check the flake for correctness across all defined systems, use:
    - `nix flake check --all-systems`
- **Updating Inputs:** To update all flake inputs, use:
    - `nix flake update`
- **Applying Configuration:** The user will typically handle applying the configuration manually with `nh os switch`. Do not attempt to apply changes unless explicitly asked.
- **Editing Secrets:** Secrets are encrypted with `sops`. To edit a secret, use the `sops` command.
    - `sops <path/to/secret.sops.yaml>`

## Code Structure & Conventions

### Adding New Packages/Applications

1.  **Machine-Specific (Limited Use):** If a package is needed on only one machine, add it directly to that machine's `configuration.nix` (e.g., `machines/navi/configuration.nix`).
2.  **Global (Simple Package):** If a package should be available on all machines and requires no special configuration, add it to the main list in `modules/programs/default.nix`.
3.  **Global (With Configuration):** For applications that require configuration, files, or persisted state:
    - Create a new module file (e.g., `modules/programs/new-app.nix`).
    - In this file, define the necessary NixOS and/or Home Manager options.
    - Import the new module into `modules/programs/default.nix`.
    - Enable the module where needed (e.g., in a specific machine's configuration).

### Adding New Services

- Follow the same pattern as for applications with configuration, but place the new module within the `modules/services/` directory.

### File naming and organisation

Names of files and directories should be in lowercase, with dashes between words â€” kebab case, not camel case.
For instance, it should be `all-packages.nix`, not `allPackages.nix` or `AllPackages.nix`.

### Formatting

CI [enforces](./.github/workflows/lint.yml) all Nix files to be formatted using the [official Nix formatter](https://github.com/NixOS/nixfmt).

You can ensure this locally using either of these commands:
```
nix-shell --run treefmt
nix develop --command treefmt
nix fmt
```

If you're starting your editor in `nix-shell` or `nix develop`, you can also set it up to automatically run `treefmt` on save.

If you have any problems with formatting, please ping the [formatting team](https://nixos.org/community/teams/formatting/) via [@NixOS/nix-formatting](https://github.com/orgs/NixOS/teams/nix-formatting).

### Syntax

- Set up [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org) for your editor, such that [the settings](./.editorconfig) are automatically applied.

- Use `lowerCamelCase` for variable names, not `UpperCamelCase`.
  Note, this rule does not apply to package attribute names, which instead follow the rules in [package naming](./pkgs/README.md#package-naming).

- Functions should list their expected arguments as precisely as possible.
  That is, write

  ```nix
  {
    stdenv,
    fetchurl,
    perl,
  }:
  <...>
  ```

  instead of

  ```nix
  args: with args; <...>
  ```

  **Important exception: NixOS modules must use `...`**

  NixOS modules (files that define `options` and `config` sections) require `...` because the module system passes additional arguments automatically. For modules, use:

  ```nix
  {
    config,
    lib,
    pkgs,
    ...
  }:
  {
    options = { ... };
    config = { ... };
  }
  ```

  Only remove `...` from simple package definitions or pure configuration files that are not part of the NixOS module system.

  For functions that are truly generic in the number of arguments, but have some required arguments, you should write them using an `@`-pattern:

  ```nix
  {
    stdenv,
    doCoverageAnalysis ? false,
    ...
  }@args:

  stdenv.mkDerivation (args // { foo = if doCoverageAnalysis then "bla" else ""; })
  ```

  instead of

  ```nix
  args:

  args.stdenv.mkDerivation (
    args
    // {
      foo = if args ? doCoverageAnalysis && args.doCoverageAnalysis then "bla" else "";
    }
  )
  ```

- Unnecessary string conversions should be avoided.
  Do

  ```nix
  { rev = version; }
  ```

  instead of

  ```nix
  { rev = "${version}"; }
  ```

- Building lists conditionally _should_ be done with `lib.optional(s)` instead of using `if cond then [ ... ] else null` or `if cond then [ ... ] else [ ]`.

  ```nix
  { buildInputs = lib.optional stdenv.hostPlatform.isDarwin iconv; }
  ```

  instead of

  ```nix
  { buildInputs = if stdenv.hostPlatform.isDarwin then [ iconv ] else null; }
  ```

  As an exception, an explicit conditional expression with null can be used when fixing a important bug without triggering a mass rebuild.
  If this is done a follow up pull request _should_ be created to change the code to `lib.optional(s)`.

### Secrets Management

- Secrets are co-located with the modules that use them (e.g., `modules/qutebrowser/secrets/`).
- The public age key for encryption is located in the root `.sops.yaml` file. Do not ask for this key.
- When adding a new secret, create a new `.sops.yaml` file in the appropriate module directory.

## Workflows

### Committing and Deploying Changes

When changes are ready to be committed and deployed, follow this specific sequence:

1.  **Commit:** Stage the changes and write a descriptive commit message.
2.  **Build:** Verify the configuration builds successfully with `nh os build`.
3.  **Check:** Run the flake checker with `nix flake check --all-systems`.
4.  **Switch:** Apply the new configuration with `nh os switch`.
5.  **Push:** If all previous steps succeed, push the changes with `git push`.

### Temporary Testing Changes

The user may request changes for testing purposes that should not be committed. In these cases, modify the necessary files and run `nh os switch` to apply the changes, but do not stage or commit them.

### General Workflow Principles

- **Atomic Changes:** Group all related modifications (e.g., creating a new module, importing it, and removing the old package entry) into a single logical change and commit them together.
- **Git Tracking for Nix:** New files must be added to Git (and ideally committed) *before* Nix commands (like `nh os switch` or `nix flake check`) can recognize them.
- **Efficiency of `nh os switch`/`nh os build`:** These commands can be time-consuming. Use them judiciously, only after a complete set of related changes has been applied, and then await user feedback before further iterations. Do not use them as part of an iterative debugging process unless explicitly instructed.
- **Trusting User Feedback:** If the user confirms a fix, trust that feedback and move on, rather than attempting further "fixes" based on assumptions.
